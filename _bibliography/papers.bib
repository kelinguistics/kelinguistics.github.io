  abstract={The variation between the alveolar and velar forms (ING) has been widely used in conveying social meanings for native speakers in many English varieties. L2 speakers' perception of (ING), however, remains unknown. The presented study employs a matched guise task exploring Chinese listeners’ mental representations of the (ING) variable, and a social network questionnaire, assessing how their associations interact with the levels of integration in the host society. Results from multivariate analysis show that (1) listeners with higher social network strengths perceived the speakers to be less educated,regardless of the (ING) variant; (2) the velar variant was perceived as more educated; (3) speakers'mgender, and regional background had greater impacts on listeners' ratings than the (ING) guise.},
