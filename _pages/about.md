I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate (ABD) studying [Linguistics at Georgetown University](https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/). Currently, I am working on my dissertation project, assessing Mandarin-English bilinguals and Russian-English bilinguals' **_implicit_** and **_explicit_** perceptual adjustments on VOT boundaries as a function of perceived talker's native language status. This dissertation is advised by [Elizabeth Zsiga](https://zsigae.com/), [Lourdes Ortega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes_Ortega), [Lacey Wade](https://laceywade.github.io/), and [Sarah Phillips](https://sarahfphillips.com/).

Before coming to Georgetown, I earned an MA in Slavic Linguistics at The Ohio State University, where I also indepedently taught Russian language courses for two years. My master's thesis investigated the social perceptions of non-native accents in Russian.

Broadly, my research centers on the field of sociophonetics. As a sociophonetician, I explore the intricate relationship between social cues and their impact on both speech perception and production. I am also interested in the phenomenon of speech convergence, the process through which speakers align their speech patterns at various phonetic levels.

Here are some of my other ongoing research projects/interests, varying in scope and development. I welcome proposals for collaboration or discussions on these topics:

- Social speech perception & production among/by L2 speakers;
- Accessible & affordable eye-tracking methods;
- Mergers and splits in Sichuan and Dongbei dialects;
- Semantic clusters and distributions of Russian prepositions
