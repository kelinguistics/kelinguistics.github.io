I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Linguistics at Northwestern University](https://linguistics.northwestern.edu/). I work with [Dr. Ann Bradlow](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/ann-bradlow/) and [Dr. Matt Goldrick](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/matt-goldrick/#!/) to develop novel bilingual phonetic corpora, conduct perceptual experiments, and apply machine-learning techniques to better understand speech variation and intelligibility across languages. 
### Current NSF-funded projects include:
- **_LangDiv: Talker-specific, language-specific, and language-general characteristics of first-language and second-language speech_** — developing a multilingual, publicly available speech corpus (“Hub-and-Spoke Corpus”) to investigate how talker traits, language structure, and bilingual mode jointly shape speech production and perception.  

- **_Enhancing research on speech and deep learning through holistic acoustic analysis_** — advancing unsupervised deep-learning methods for discovering representational spaces of speech, integrating computational and phonetic analyses to model human and machine speech processing.

I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics [Georgetown University] in October 2025(https://linguistics.georgetown.edu/), where I investigated how perceived talker nativeness shapes Mandarin–English and Russian–English bilinguals’ **_implicit_** and **_explicit perceptual_** adjustments to VOT boundaries. This dissertation is advised by [Elizabeth Zsiga](https://zsigae.com/), [Lourdes Ortega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes_Ortega), [Lacey Wade](https://laceywade.github.io/), and [Sarah Phillips](https://sarahfphillips.com/).

Before coming to Georgetown, I earned an MA in Slavic Linguistics at The Ohio State University, where I also indepedently taught Russian language courses for two years. My master's thesis investigated the social perceptions of non-native accents in Russian.

Broadly, my research centers on the field of sociophonetics. As a sociophonetician, I explore the intricate relationship between social cues and their impact on both speech perception and production. I am also interested in the phenomenon of speech convergence, the process through which speakers align their speech patterns at various phonetic levels.

Here are some of my other ongoing research projects/interests, varying in scope and development. I welcome proposals for collaboration or discussions on these topics:

- Socially modulated perception & production among/by L2 speakers;
- Accessible & affordable eye-tracking methods;
- Individual (cognitive) differences in bilingual speech processing
- Semantic clusters and distributions of Russian prepositions
